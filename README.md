# Image_Depth_Estimation

This repository focuses on **Stereo Matching** by implementing several algorithms to compute Disparity Maps from given stereo image pairs. The Disparity Map provides essential depth information, allowing us to infer the actual depth of objects in a scene. Through these algorithms, the repository demonstrates how to extract and utilize depth information from stereo images, which is crucial for various applications such as 3D reconstruction, robotics, and computer vision.
